# Tic-Tac-Toe

Fully deployed site [here](https://cagallo.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)!

We're all familiar with the game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but have you ever played a Dog vs. Cat themed version? If not, today is your lucky day! You see, this game is based on the real life rivalry of my beloved dog Teddy and his arch nemesis(whom I love dearly as well), Felix the cat. Play the game and see if reigning King Felix will still hold supremacy on the mean streets of LoHi or if the young and handsome Prince Teddy will usurp him of his kingly title and position.

## Description

Users(number of players: 2) can choose whether to play Felix üê± (player one on the left) or Teddy üê∂ (player two on the right). A winner is displayed at the top of the board once a user has clicked three squares in a row. If users do not click three squares in a row, the game is declared a draw and the game is refreshed.

## Project Wins and Challenges

I felt fairly comfortable with using classes/data model and connecting it to the DOM. Playing the game on the console prior to connecting the data model to the DOM was very informative. I felt like the project was a good finale that connected everything we've learned in Mod 1.

I had challenges with the CSS layout and responsive design. I had issues with getting the board the right size without affecting the grid and the tokens. I was also not great with creating branches and pull requests for this project. I need to work more on my git workflow; just because I'm working alone doesn't mean that I can slack on it.
